{Career JVM developer with 10 years of Clojure experience. I'm a self-reliant pragmatist with a track
record of delivering modern software solutions on a large commercial scale. Have a keen passion for tech and enjoying keeping
abreast of modern frameworks and ways of working. I have a lot of experience working on large microservice based
event streaming and restful platforms across various cloud providers and I'm looking for an agile environment where I can put this
experience to use.
